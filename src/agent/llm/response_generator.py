# ── Recovery guard labels ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# These are Python-internal routing labels passed to generate_recovery_message().
# They are NOT LLM extraction outputs (see llm/schema.py EventType for those).
#
# Label            | Produced by              | Meaning
# -----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------
# "RETRY"          | _collect_slot            | Genuine failed answer — attempt counted
# "CLARIFY"        | _collect_slot            | First AMBIGUOUS turn — no attempt cost;
#                  |                          | ask caller to repeat more clearly
# "CORRECTION"     | _generate_correction_ack | Caller corrected a confirmed slot
# "INTERRUPTION"   | guards.py                | Caller switched topic mid-collection
# "OFFTOPIC_AGENT" | guards.py                | Wrong-agent topic — steer back
# "OFFTOPIC"       | guards.py (fallback)     | Legacy alias for OFFTOPIC_AGENT
# "FOLLOWUP_ANSWER"| _collect_slot (Phase 4)  | Slot confirmed + side question that is
#                  |                          | answerable from Confirmed values now
# "FOLLOWUP_PARK"  | _collect_slot (Phase 4)  | Slot confirmed + side question parked
#                  |                          | for later in the call — acknowledge only
# "FOLLOWUP_DECLINE"| _collect_slot (Phase 4) | Slot confirmed + side question we cannot
#                  |                          | answer — acknowledge and move on
# "CORRECTION_ACK" | _handle_answered_followup| Slot confirmed + correction applied,
#                  | (Phase 2 hygiene)        | no side question — acknowledge both
#
# For the FOLLOWUP_* and CORRECTION_ACK labels the model must NOT ask for any
# slot — Python appends the next static ask (or a detour ask) after the
# generated sentence.
#
# The distinction between RETRY and CLARIFY matters:
#   RETRY   → attempt_count was just incremented; LLM should re-ask firmly
#   CLARIFY → attempt_count unchanged; LLM should re-ask gently, no implication
#             that the caller did anything wrong
