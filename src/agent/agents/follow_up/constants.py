# ── New-intake-intent restart ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

# mid-follow-up, the call is fully reset and re-routed through verification.
# Mirrors the routable service flows in intake.models.IntentTag.
INTAKE_INTENTS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"provider_services", "claim_services"})

# Subset of INTAKE_INTENTS that must be handed back to the *intake* agent rather
# than straight to verification, so intake re-applies its front-door screening
# (e.g. the unsupported-provider-type gate that escalates before identity is ever
# collected). Intents NOT listed here stay on the direct-to-verification path.
#
# claim_services is intentionally excluded: it has no unsupported-type gate at
# intake, so re-screening would add nothing and only cost an extra intake hop.
# Adding "claim_services" here is the ONLY change needed to re-screen claims too.

# Appeal / grievance keyword gate. Appeals and grievances are out_of_scope topics
# (see extraction/intake.md) that intake routes to the appeals/grievance team. The
# follow-up classifier has NO tag for them, and its new_intent branch only fires on
# a cross-intent switch (provider ↔ claim) — so an appeal raised mid-call surfaces
# as a plain `question`. This keyword set lets follow_up detect them directly and
# reroute back through intake for out_of_scope screening, independent of the LLM
# classification. Matched as whole words (word boundaries) to avoid false positives.
