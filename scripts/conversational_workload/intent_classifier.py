"""
Deterministic slot classifier for PCP evaluation flow.
Keyword-based matching — clarification/correction checks run before slot checks
so that re-ask and ack messages are not misclassified as regular slot prompts.

FIXES (stability — these were sources of intermittent eval failures):
  1. The zip_update list contained "provide.*zip" used in a plain substring
     test — regex syntax in a `in` check can never match. Replaced with a
     real regex plus literal phrases, so rephrased ZIP re-asks ("could you
     provide your ZIP code?") classify as zip_update, not zip_confirm.
  2. benefits_offer is now checked BEFORE the zip checks. The dispatch
     confirmation can now include the updated ZIP ("...for your current ZIP
     code 02139 within 30 minutes. ...would you like to also get the
     benefits..."); the old order classified that message as zip_confirm and
     produced the wrong fallback ground truth ("Yes, that's correct").
  3. The bare "zip code" → zip_confirm fallback is guarded against dispatch
     messages ("within 30 minutes").
  4. coach_offer requires an actual offer question ("would you like" /
     "want" / "do you want"), so the Care-Coach *dispatch* message
     ("We will send the Care Coach details... Is there anything else?")
     classifies as follow_up instead of coach_offer.
  5. Claim flow: the N1 ask can be phrased "phone or email" — added to the
     channel phrase lists (it previously fell through to "other").
  6. Claim flow: N1 bridge vs N2 ask disambiguation. Both contain a channel
     phrase + "updates"; N1 mentions the provider outreach / Personal Guide,
     N2 mentions progress updates "in this request". The guide-scheduled /
     N1-bridge check now runs BEFORE the N2 check, and the N2 check excludes
     provider-outreach wording.
