ROLE: Extract the member's response to a name readback / confirmation.

The agent just read back the member's full name, spelled letter by letter, and asked
"is that correct?". There are exactly three valid outcomes — extract accordingly.

FIELDS
  name_confirmed  "yes" | "no"
    "yes" — member confirmed the name is correct:
      "yes", "yep", "correct", "that's right", "yes that's me",
      "yes that's correct", "yes that's my name" → yes

    "no" — member rejected the name (bare no, no replacement given):
      "no", "nope", "that's wrong", "that's not right",
      "no that's not me", "incorrect" → no
      Only extract "no" here when the member gives NO new name in the same utterance.

  first_name  Title Case string
    The corrected first name, when the member declines AND gives the right name inline:
      "no it's Jhon", "no, my name is Jhon Doe", "actually it's Jhon" → Jhon
    Only extract when the member is actively providing a replacement first name.

  last_name  Title Case string
    The corrected last name, when the member declines AND gives the right name inline.
    Often given together with first_name in the same utterance.

CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULE — three outcomes, mutually exclusive:

  OUTCOME 1 — confirmed (yes):
    name_confirmed = "yes", first_name omitted, last_name omitted

  OUTCOME 2 — declined with inline correction:
    name_confirmed omitted, first_name = "<corrected>", last_name = "<corrected>"
    (or just first_name if only first name was given)
    This fires when the member says the wrong name AND provides the correct one
    in the same utterance. Do NOT also set name_confirmed = "no".

  OUTCOME 3 — bare no (no correction given):
    name_confirmed = "no", first_name omitted, last_name omitted
    Only use when the member clearly rejected the name but gave no replacement.

Examples:
  "yes that's correct"                     → name_confirmed="yes"
  "yes"                                    → name_confirmed="yes"
  "yep, that's me"                         → name_confirmed="yes"
  "no"                                     → name_confirmed="no"
  "nope that's wrong"                      → name_confirmed="no"
  "no it's Jhon"                           → first_name="Jhon"
  "no, it's Jhon Doe"                   → first_name="Jhon", last_name="Doe"
  "actually my name is Jhon Doe"        → first_name="Jhon", last_name="Doe"
  "no that's not right, it's Jhon Doe"  → first_name="Jhon", last_name="Doe"
  "yes j h o n d o e"             → name_confirmed="yes"

NAME PLAUSIBILITY — same rule as verification:
  Accept any plausible human name (any culture, hyphenated, apostrophe).
  Reject only clear non-names (numbers, gibberish).

CONFIDENCE NOTES
  Only extract when the member's intent is unambiguous.
  Hesitation or spelling filler words ("um", "let me think") → event_type "ambiguous".
  If the member only gives a first name (no last name), extract first_name only.
