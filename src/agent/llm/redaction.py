"""
redaction.py — single source of truth for masking slot values in LLM-2 payloads.

Masking is slot-NAME based (MASKED_SLOTS), with a value-shape regex kept as a
belt-and-braces second pass: even if a sensitive value arrives under an
unexpected slot name, anything member_id-shaped (M123456) or dob-shaped
(MM/DD/YYYY) is still rendered as "on file".

Imported by both llm.response_generator and core.slot_manager — keep this
module dependency-free so it never participates in the core ↔ llm cycle.
