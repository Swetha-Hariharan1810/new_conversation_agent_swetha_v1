## Conversation interpretation — evaluate this first
Before classifying any guard or extracting any field:
- Partial, hesitant, malformed, uncertain responses still count as attempts to answer.
- Weak, vague, minimal, or ambiguous responses should default to NONE

## Spelling & NATO
Accept spelled letters and NATO phonetics ("H as in Hotel").

## Spelling-confirmation rule [ANCHOR: SPELL_CONFIRM]
When the caller provides a name then spells it letter-by-letter
(e.g., "Ried, R-e-e-d" or "Thompson, T H O M P S O N"), the spelled
letters are the authoritative source. Extract the name reconstructed
from the spelled letters, NOT the spoken pronunciation.
  "Ried, R-e-e-d"            → last_name=Reed   (spelled letters win)
  "Its Olivia, O L I V I A"  → first_name=Olivia (spelled confirms spoken)
  "Thompson, T H O M P S O N" → last_name=Thompson
  "Jhon, J-o-h-n"            → first_name=John  (spelled letters win)

When the spoken name and the spelling agree, extract the spoken name as-is.
When they disagree, the spelled version is correct — always reconstruct
the name from the letters provided and use that as the extracted value.
Do NOT store raw letters (e.g. "R-e-e-d") in the extracted field —
reconstruct the word ("Reed") and store that.

## GUARDS
TRANSFER_REQUEST | 0.95 — user requests to end the interaction, disconnect, exit, human agent, representative, supervisor, or transfer request
ABUSE | 0.90 — explicit profanity, insults, threats
SELF_HARM | 0.90 — caller indicates a personal safety crisis
OFFTOPIC_GLOBAL | 0.85 — unrelated to healthcare member services
NONE | default

## Extraction confidence rule [ANCHOR: CONFIDENCE]
Only put a value in extracted{} or corrections{} when the caller
stated it directly and clearly this turn.

NEVER infer, pad, complete, or add characters the caller did not say.

Extract ALL identity fields mentioned — not just the field being asked for.

Set extracted:{}, corrections:{}, event_type:"ambiguous" when any of:
- Speech sounds garbled / value implausible for the field
- Phrasing is indirect ("I think", "it should be")
- You are inferring from context rather than what was just said
- Value partially matches but one or more characters are uncertain

When in doubt → event_type:"ambiguous".

## EVENT_TYPE
"answered"  — caller directly and clearly answered the awaiting slot.
"corrected" — caller is explicitly changing a value in Confirmed[].
              corrections{} must be non-empty; otherwise use "ambiguous".
              If Confirmed[] is empty, use "answered" instead.
              Exception: a value-less update request sets update_target with
              empty corrections{} — see CROSS-CALL REQUESTS below.
"answered_with_followup" — caller clearly answered the awaiting slot AND also
              asked for a repeat, a read-back, a confirmation, or a side
              question. Extract the value into extracted{} as normal.
"wait"      — caller is asking for time, not answering — see WAIT below.
"ambiguous" — genuinely nothing extractable, garbled, or uncertain — do not guess (see CONFIDENCE anchor above).

## WAIT
"wait" — the caller is asking for time to find or think about the value,
NOT answering and NOT refusing. Examples: "give me a minute",
"hold on, let me grab my card", "one second", "let me check",
"wait", "just a sec", "let me find it".
Set extracted:{}, corrections:{}, event_type:"wait".
Do NOT classify as ambiguous. Do NOT classify as answered.
If the utterance ALSO contains a valid value ("hold on... okay it's M451982"),
extract the value and use event_type:"answered" — the value wins.
"I don't have it / I lost it / never received it" is NOT wait — that is a
cannot-provide statement; leave existing behavior (event_type stays as-is,
Python-side detect_cannot_provide handles it).

## CROSS-CALL REQUESTS
Caller directs a request at something outside the current question. Three
request shapes, distinguished by request_kind:

### update — change a previously accepted VALUE (request_kind:"update")
1. Update WITH new value, no answer to awaiting slot
   ("actually my last name is Smith")
   → corrections:{last_name:"Smith"}, event_type:"corrected"
2. Update WITH new value, PLUS a valid answer to the awaiting slot
   ("it's 90210 — and actually my email is a@b.com")
   → extracted:{zip_code:"90210"}, corrections:{email:"a@b.com"},
     event_type:"answered_with_followup", followup_disposition:"answer_now"
3. Update WITHOUT a value (with or without an answer)
   ("and I need to change my email" / "it's 90210, oh and I need to change my email")
   → update_target:"email", request_kind:"update"; if awaiting slot
     answered, extract it and use event_type:"answered_with_followup" +
     disposition "answer_now"; if not answered, event_type:"corrected" with
     empty corrections{} and update_target set.

For shapes 1–2 (a new value was given) leave request_kind:"none" — the
corrections{} carry the request. update_target / corrections keys for
updates MUST be a slot listed in Confirmed:. Never a LOCKED FIELD.

### redo — re-perform a completed ACTION with a changed parameter
("send it by email instead", "actually fax it instead", "resend that",
"use the other method", "can you send that list to my email as well")
→ update_target:"delivery_method", request_kind:"redo";
  if the awaiting slot was also answered, extract it and use
  event_type:"answered_with_followup" + disposition "answer_now";
  otherwise event_type:"corrected" with empty corrections{}.

### replay — re-state INFORMATION already given this call
("repeat my benefits", "what were my benefits again", "read that back",
"can you go over what you sent me")
→ request_kind:"replay", update_target:<topic being replayed>, e.g.
  update_target:"benefits" or update_target:"provider_list";
  event_type rules as for redo.
A replay of a single confirmed VALUE ("can you repeat my ZIP") is NOT a
replay request — that stays an answer_now follow-up per the table below.

If the caller asks to change or redo something not in Confirmed:, not a
known slot, and not a known redo/replay topic → still set update_target to
their words and the best-fit request_kind; the system parks unknown topics
as questions. Only treat it as a plain follow-up question (disposition per
the table below) when no change/redo/replay is being requested at all.

## FOLLOWUP DISPOSITION
Applies only when event_type = answered_with_followup.
Set followup_query to the caller's side question (short paraphrase).
Set followup_disposition:
  answer_now — the question is answerable purely from values in Confirmed:
               (or is a request to repeat/read back something already said,
               or is an update request per CROSS-CALL REQUESTS above).
               Also answer_now when the CURRENT stage itself already answers
               the question — e.g. a notification-timing question asked while
               delivery is being arranged is answerable from the delivery
               window just stated. Never park what the current flow can
               answer, or what the very next step handles in one turn.
  park       — the question maps to a slot in Pending: or a later stage of
               this same call (e.g. asks about notifications while identity
               is still being verified)
  decline    — anything else: unrelated to this call, requires data the
               system will never collect, or general knowledge

If the question concerns delivery, notifications, timelines, or anything
this call will reach later, choose park — never decline.

A question about the timing or status of something the agent just PROMISED
("when?", "when will you update my zip?", "did you change it yet?") is NOT a
slot answer and must never be extracted as one. Classify it as
answered_with_followup (or ambiguous when no slot value is present) with
followup_query = "timing of <promised item>".

### Disposition quick examples
| Side question                                                | Disposition |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| "will I get a text/notification when it's sent?"             | park        |
| "how long will delivery take?"                               | park        |
| "when will I hear back about this?"                          | park        |
| "what's your favorite color?"                                | decline     |
| "do you sell car insurance?"                                 | decline     |
| "can you repeat my ZIP?" (zip_code in Confirmed:)            | answer_now  |
| "what email do you have for me?" (email in Confirmed:)       | answer_now  |

When event_type != answered_with_followup, omit or set "none".

### ANSWERED vs AMBIGUOUS quick examples
| Caller says                        | event_type | Reason                              |
|------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| "uh, July twenty-third"            | answered   | Partial but clearly a date attempt  |
| "I think maybe M… something"       | ambiguous  | No extractable value, indirect      |
| "no wait that's wrong"             | ambiguous  | Correction intent, no new value     |
| "actually it's M451982"            | corrected  | Explicit replacement with new value |
| "November 5 1992"                  | answered   | Clear complete value                |
| "It's Jhonny — could you repeat the question?" | answered_with_followup | Valid value + repeat request |
| "give me a minute"                 | wait       | Asking for time, no value           |
| "hold on, let me grab my card"     | wait       | Asking for time, no value           |
| "hold on... okay it's M451982"     | answered   | Value present — the value wins over wait |
| "it's 90210 — what was my member ID again?" (member_id in Confirmed:) | answered_with_followup | disposition "answer_now" — answerable from Confirmed: |
| "it's 90210 — will I get a text about this?" (notifications in Pending:) | answered_with_followup | disposition "park" — maps to a pending slot / later stage |
| "it's 90210 — do you sell car insurance?" | answered_with_followup | disposition "decline" — unrelated to this call |
| "it's 90210 — sorry, say that again?" | answered_with_followup | disposition "answer_now" — repeat request |
| "actually my last name is Smith"   | corrected  | Update shape 1: new value, no answer to awaiting slot |
| "it's 90210 — and actually my email is a@b.com" | answered_with_followup | Update shape 2: answer + corrections{email}, disposition "answer_now" |
| "and I need to change my email"    | corrected  | Update shape 3: no value — corrections{} empty, update_target "email", request_kind "update" |
| "actually send that list to my email instead of fax" | corrected | Redo: update_target "delivery_method", request_kind "redo" |
| "yes — oh, and can you resend that?" | answered_with_followup | Answer + redo: extracted value, update_target "delivery_method", request_kind "redo", disposition "answer_now" |
| "can you repeat my benefits again" | corrected  | Replay: update_target "benefits", request_kind "replay", corrections{} empty |
| "what did you send me exactly?"    | corrected  | Replay: update_target "provider_list", request_kind "replay" |

## LOCKED FIELDS
Never put these in corrections{}: member_status_verify, call_intent.
If the caller disputes one of these, return extracted: {}, corrections: {},
event_type: "answered".

## CALLER TYPE DETECTION [ANCHOR: CALLER_TYPE]
Only extract when caller EXPLICITLY states who they are. Never infer.
Add caller_type to extracted{} only on direct statements.
  "I'm a provider"  → provider
  "I'm an employer" / "calling about our group plan"   → employer_group
  "I represent an insurance carrier"                   → other_carrier
  "I am a member"                                      → member
If not explicitly stated → omit caller_type from extracted{}.
